# Summary
This repository contains code to achieve the geometry-aware phase retrieval described in the paper "General approaches for shear-correcting coordinate transformations in Bragg coherent diffraction imaging: Part 2". It includes Matlab code for the geometry-aware 3D FFT and backprojection-based reconstruction method described in this paper.
